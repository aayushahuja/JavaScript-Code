1)Animated banner: a starter to java-script animation.(http://aayushahuja.byethost7.com/banner/)
  It draws moving circles within an area.When two circles come close, line joining their center is drawn + some mouse functionality.
  It was my first attempt with JQuery and Raphael javascript libraries and was made within in a day :)
